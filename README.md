#### Title
**`Cisco 1000 Series Switch Automation Upgrade Script`**

#### Description
This repository provides a Python-based automation script for upgrading Cisco 1000 Series switch firmware via Telnet. The script simplifies the firmware upgrade process, configures VLANs, validates boot paths, and manages system reloads, making it a robust solution for network engineers.

#### Features
- **Automates** firmware upgrade and configuration tasks on Cisco 1000 switches.
- **Interacts via Telnet**, making it compatible with devices that support Telnet.
- **Monitors the upgrade process** in real-time.
- **Handles VLAN configurations**, boot settings, and system reloads.

#### Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Telnet Support**: Ensure the Cisco switch supports Telnet.

#### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cisco-1000-switch-automation-upgrade.git
   cd cisco-1000-switch-automation-upgrade
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Add `telnetlib` if additional requirements are necessary in the `requirements.txt` file.)*

#### Configuration
1. **Edit the Configuration File:**
   Create a configuration file (e.g., `config/config.yaml`) with connection details and firmware file locations.
   
   Example YAML configuration:
   ```yaml
   switch:
     host: "192.168.20.1"
     firmware_server: "192.168.20.2"
     firmware_file: "c1000-universalk9-tar.152-7.E10.tar"
     vlan:
       id: 3
       name: "Python_VLAN_3"
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python upgrade_script.py --config config/config.yaml
   ```

#### Usage
The script logs into the Cisco switch via Telnet, downloads firmware from a TFTP server, configures VLANs, validates boot paths, and reloads the switch.

1. **Start the upgrade:** The script initiates a firmware download and waits until the installation completes.
2. **Configure VLANs** as per the script or configuration.
3. **Validate and set boot parameters.**
4. **Reload the switch** to apply changes.

#### Logs
Logs are generated in the `/logs` directory to monitor upgrade steps and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Troubleshooting
- Ensure Telnet access and connectivity to the TFTP server.
- Verify firmware file path on the TFTP server.
