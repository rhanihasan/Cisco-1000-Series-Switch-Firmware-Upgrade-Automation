Title
Cisco 1000 Series Switch Automation Upgrade Script

Description
This repository provides a Python-based automation script for upgrading Cisco 1000 Series switch firmware via Telnet. The script simplifies the firmware upgrade process, configures VLANs, validates boot paths, and manages system reloads, making it a robust solution for network engineers.

Features
Automates firmware upgrade and configuration tasks on Cisco 1000 switches.
Interacts via Telnet, making it compatible with devices that support Telnet.
Monitors the upgrade process in real-time.
Handles VLAN configurations, boot settings, and system reloads.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Telnet Support: Ensure the Cisco switch supports Telnet.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cisco-1000-switch-automation-upgrade.git
cd cisco-1000-switch-automation-upgrade
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Add telnetlib if additional requirements are necessary in the requirements.txt file.)

Configuration
Edit the Configuration File: Create a configuration file (e.g., config/config.yaml) with connection details and firmware file locations.

Example YAML configuration:

yaml
Copy code
switch:
  host: "192.168.20.1"
  firmware_server: "192.168.20.2"
  firmware_file: "c1000-universalk9-tar.152-7.E10.tar"
  vlan:
    id: 3
    name: "Python_VLAN_3"
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python upgrade_script.py --config config/config.yaml
Usage
The script logs into the Cisco switch via Telnet, downloads firmware from a TFTP server, configures VLANs, validates boot paths, and reloads the switch.

Start the upgrade: The script initiates a firmware download and waits until the installation completes.
Configure VLANs as per the script or configuration.
Validate and set boot parameters.
Reload the switch to apply changes.
Logs
Logs are generated in the /logs directory to monitor upgrade steps and troubleshoot any issues.

Troubleshooting
Ensure Telnet access and connectivity to the TFTP server.
Verify firmware file path on the TFTP server.
